# 2022-03-05 Project 1 Notes


## Questions
- Ask Tyler if he wants to meet Monday morning, since I'm available
- Does forked github repo record activity in green bars?
- README.md says "complete the Project Proposal which must be reviewed by your instructor before you can continue with the project", but link to Project Proposal is broken. Is this referring to the contract? Or is the proposal located somewhere else?

## Some Responsibilities to assign
- Finalize Stylish Presentation Slides
- Host GitHub repo
- Write README.md for GitHub repo
- Edit / finalize Markdown in .ipynb file

## Decisions to be made:
- Decide which GitHub repo to start with:
	- MVP branch of [Phase 1 Project Templates and Examples repo](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-project-template)
	- Fork [Phase 1 Project Repository](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-phase-1-project-v2-3) and edit `student.ipynb`
	- Create new repo from scratch 

## To-Do:
1. Complete the Project Proposal which must be reviewed by your instructor before you can continue with the project.
2. Select time for 1:1 checkin with David and Daniel about the project [9am, 9:30am, 11am, 11:30am](https://calendly.com/david-elliott-1-1/phase-1-project-group-check-ins?month=2022-03&date=2022-03-09)


## Notes
- Movie Data ERD
	- `runtime_minutes` and 'genres' in `movie_basics`
	- 'types', `language`, `region` in `movie_akas`
	- 'averagerating' and 'numvotes' in `movie_ratings`
- `bom.movie_gross.csv.gz`
	- One apparent problem, there's no specific key to match to data in im.db
	- movie `title`, `studio`, and `year` as keys to match
	- `domestic_gross` and `foreign_gross`
- `tmdb.movies.csv.gz`
	- `popularity`, `vote_average`, `vote_count` columns
	- `genre_ids` # I wonder whether number of genres affects ratings or gross
